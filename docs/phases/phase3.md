# Phase 3: Detailed Views and Advanced Features

## Goal: Refine the UI to properly display all data types and add quality-of-life features.

- [x] Task 3.1: In the KeyViewer component, use v-if/v-else or dynamic components to render different views based on the key's type (String, List, Hash, Set, Sorted Set).
- [x] Task 3.2: Implement a search/filter bar for the key list. This will involve updating the `/api/keys` endpoint in Go to accept a pattern parameter.
- [x] Task 3.3: Add pagination to the key list on both the frontend and backend for handling large datasets.
- [x] Task 3.4: Implement robust error handling and user feedback for failed connections or API calls.
- [x] Task 3.5: Write a README.md file explaining how to launch the entire application with a single docker-compose up command.
